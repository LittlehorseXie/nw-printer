# **node-tar.gz**
Native gzip compression and decompression utility for Node.js.

### **Installation**

For simple installation:

    npm install tar.gz

If you want to use the `targz` command line:

    npm intall -g tar.gz

### **Usage**

At the moment this package can only compress a folder and everything that
is inside it. To compress something is easy:

    var targz = require('tar.gz');
    var compress = new targz().compress('/path/to/compress', '/path/to/store.tar.gz', function(err){
        if(err)
            console.log(err);

        console.log('The compression has ended!');
    });

With the same easy you can extract a gziped file:

    var targz = require('tar.gz');
    var compress = new targz().extract('/path/to/stored.tar.gz', '/path/to/extract', function(err){
        if(err)
            console.log(err);

        console.log('The extraction has ended!');
    });

You can pass some configuration parameters to the constructor before compress:

    var targz = require('tar.gz');

    var level = 6 //the compression level from 0-9, default: 6
    var memLevel = 6 //the memory allocation level from 1-9, default: 6
    var proprietary = true //to include or not proprietary headers, default: true

    var compress = new targz(level, memLevel, proprietary).compress(...)

### **Command line**

    $ targz -h

      Usage: targz [options]

      Options:

        -h, --help           output usage information
        -V, --version        output the version number
        -c, --compress       Compress folder to archive
        -x, --extract        Extract archive to folder
        -l, --level [n]      Compression level from 0-9. Default 6.
        -m, --memory [n]     Memory allocation level from 1-9. Default 6.
        -n, --noproprietary  Remove proprietary headers.

      Examples:

        Default compression
        $ targz -c /folder/to/compres /path/to/archive.tar.gz

        Extracting some archive
        $ targz -x /path/to/archive.tar.gz /destination/folder

        Maximum compression
        $ targz -l 9 -m 9 -c /folder/to/compres /path/to/archive.tar.gz


### **TODO**

 * Vows.js tests
 * Single file compression
 * Add more todos...
